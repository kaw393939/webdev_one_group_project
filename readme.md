The project is centered on consolidating your GIT collaboration techniques, familiarizing you with key web development skills, introducing you to the principles of UX design, and imbibing you with fundamental digital marketing strategies. The aim is to provide a practical perspective on creating a successful website for a business.  Your team needs to select one of the business types listed in the project description to focus on.
