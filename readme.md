The amount of work in this project is signficant and is designed to encourage you to plan your work effectivly and to require you to work as a team.  You should use ChatGPT extensivly for this project, it is very good at coming up with ideas and can help you with some of the repetitive coding tasks like making a table or converting between markdown and HTML.  

The project is centered on consolidating your GIT collaboration techniques, familiarizing you with key web development skills, introducing you to the principles of UX design, and imbibing you with fundamental digital marketing strategies. The aim is to provide a practical perspective on creating a successful website for a business.  Your team needs to select one of the business types listed in the project description to focus on.  We are focusing on generic businesses because if Starbucks can sell a 50 cent cup of coffee for $5 then you can too with a good marketing, branding, and sales strategy.
